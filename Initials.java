/*
Where did you struggle with this coding work?
I struggled on getting the letter "N" correct. Not surw what I did was the best solution.

What was easy?
The lettter "C" was easier then "N"

What questions do you still have?
Is there a better way to execute what I did. Could I have used the escap?
