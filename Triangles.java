/*
Where did you struggle with this coding work?
I initially struggles with getting the bottom triangle but I analyzed it and got it right the 2nd time

What was easy?
THe first triangle was easy but 2 so was the 2nd after my inital compiling

What questions do you still have?
No questions for now.
